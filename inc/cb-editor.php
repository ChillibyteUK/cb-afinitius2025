 * Gives the editor a root layout, so the Align control exists, without letting
 * WordPress apply layout CSS on the frontend.
 *
 * WordPress only offers "Wide width" / "Full width" on a block when a root layout
 * exists, which means `settings.layout` in theme.json. This theme had none, so the
 * Align control was missing from the toolbar entirely and any `align` attribute
 * already saved on a group was being discarded on load - which is why one group on
 * the CRA page renders full width on the frontend while having no `align` attribute
 * left in its block data.
 *
 * Putting `settings.layout` in theme.json fixes the editor but is **not safe on the
 * frontend here**. It makes WordPress emit
 * `.is-layout-constrained > * { max-width: var(--wp--style--global--content-size) }`,
 * which caps any ACF block section sitting directly inside a constrained group.
 * Those sections render their own inner `.container-xl` and are meant to be
 * full-bleed, so measured on the CRA page `section.text_image` and
 * `section.simple_cta` went from 2383px to 1320px. Hundreds of live pages are built
 * that way, so that is not an acceptable side effect of fixing a toolbar control.
 *
 * Hence: inject the layout for admin requests only. The editor gets its root layout
 * and the Align control; the frontend's theme.json still has no layout, so no layout
 * CSS is generated and rendered widths are untouched.
 *
 * If the frontend is ever reworked to use constrained layouts properly, move this
 * into theme.json and delete this filter.

 * markers when a root layout exists, which needs `settings.layout` in theme.json;

/**
 * Stops the block editor opening in fullscreen mode.
 *
 * Ported from cb-global42026, but rewritten rather than copied. That version
 * used `jQuery( window ).load()`, removed in jQuery 3 and only still working
 * here because jQuery Migrate patches it, and `core/edit-post`'s
 * `isFeatureActive()` / `toggleFeature()`, deprecated in favour of the
 * `core/preferences` store. Both were checked against this install (jQuery
 * 3.7.1, WordPress 7.0.4) before deciding.
 *
 * More importantly it changed behaviour: it toggled fullscreen off on **every**
 * load, so an editor who deliberately turned fullscreen on found it off again
 * next time and could never make it stick. `setDefaults()` only changes the
 * default, which a persisted user preference still overrides - so the editor
 * opens windowed for anyone who has not expressed a preference, and anyone who
 * wants fullscreen keeps it.
 *
 * To force it off regardless of the user's choice, swap setDefaults() for:
 *   if ( p.get( 'core', 'fullscreenMode' ) ) { d.toggle( 'core', 'fullscreenMode' ); }
 *
 * The ACF Visual/Text focus workaround from that same file was deliberately not
 * ported: `cbp-blog-options` already fixes it, and more thoroughly - it forces
 * `delay: true` on WYSIWYG fields so TinyMCE never initialises until clicked,
 * and guards the scroll position across ACF DOM mutations. The theme version
 * monkey-patched `switchEditors.go` instead, which would be a second competing
 * fix for the same problem.
